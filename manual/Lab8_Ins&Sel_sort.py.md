# Lab 8: Selection and Insertion sort using Python

## Problem statement 

Write a Python program to perform selection and insertion sort

```
sample input 0: [5,4,0,29,2]
sample output 0:[0,2,4,5,29]

sample input 1: [5,-4,0,29,2]
sample output 1:[-4,0,2,5,29] 

sample input 2: [5,4.3,0,29,4.2]
sample output 2:[0,4.2,4.3,5,29]

sample input 2: ['b','a','c']
sample output 2:['a','b','c']

```

## Solution Key

```

Selection sort

def sel(alist):
    for mylist in range(len(alist)-1,0,-1):
        max_pos=0
        for loc in range(1,mylist+1):
            if alist[loc]>alist[max_pos]:
                max_pos = loc
 
        temp = alist[mylist]
        alist[mylist] = alist[max_pos]
        alist[max_pos]=temp
    return alist       


```
```

Insertion sort

def insertion_sort(seq):
    #print (seq)
    i=1
    while i < len(seq):
        j=i
        while j!=0 and seq[j]< seq[j-1]:
                seq[j] , seq[j-1] = seq[j-1], seq[j]
                j -=1
        i +=1
    print(seq)
    return seq

```
