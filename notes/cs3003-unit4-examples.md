## Recommended sequence

# InsertionSort

## Pre-requisites

- http://j.mp/insertVisual
- http://j.mp/interactInsert using `[10, 3, 2, 4, 0, 30, 1, 5, 15]`
- `pop()` - what does it do? Does it accept any arguments? What does `push()` do? Does it accept an argument as well?
  - does `alist.pop()` have the same effect as `alist.pop(0)`?
  - How to use `pop()` to remove the last element in the list?
  - How to use `pop()` to remove the first element in the list?
  - Assume `alist` contains 4 elements `['one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'zero']`. If you execute the following code, what will be the output?
    `alist.pop(0)`
    `alist.pop()`
    `alist.pop(0)`
    `print(alist[-1], alist[0])`
  - If `ulist` is a non-zero list, what is the difference between `ulist[0]` versus `ulist.pop(0)`?
  - Contrast between `del`, `pop` and `remove` effect on a list
  - Write a code snippet which operates on a list and prints every element in it. By the time it is done, the list must be empty.
- `insert()` - what does this do? How many arguments does it accept?
  - write the equivalent of `append()` function using `insert()`
  - When `pop` method exists, why is there no `push` method? Define a suitable list operation `push`that would be perform the role of a list `push` method if it were to exist.

What will the following snippets do?

```python
alist = list(range(10))
for i in range(len(alist)):
	val = alist.pop()
	print(val, end=" ")
```

```python
alist = list(range(10))
for i in range(len(alist)):
	val = alist.pop(0)
	print(val, end =" ")
```

```python
alist = list(range(10))
for i in range(len(alist)):
	val = alist.pop(i)
	print(val, end = " ")

```

## Algorithm

- In `insertsort`, given a key, a copy of a pre-determined element in the list, we **insert** it at the appropriate location after comparing it with the unsorted elements of the list.

      mark first element as sorted
      for each unsorted element X
      	'extract' the element X as 'key'
      	insert key at the relevant index so list remains sorted
      return sorted list

More detailed pseudo-code:

    mark first element as sorted
    for each unsorted element X
      extract the element X
      for j = lastSortedIndex (position -1) down to 0
        if current element j > X
          decrement j by 1
        else break loop and insert X here
    return sorted list

## Source code

```python
def insertsort(alist):
    n = len(alist)
    # STEP 0 - iterate through the list
    for idx in range(1, n):
        # STEP 1 - element to insert
        # j, value = idx, alist.pop(idx)
        j, value = idx, alist[idx]

        # STEP 2 - decide where to insert
        sorted_already = alist[:idx]
        while j > 0 and value < sorted_already[j-1]:
            j -= 1
        # STEP 3 - insert it in the relevant index
        # alist.insert(j, value)
        if j != idx:
            alist[j+1:idx+1] = alist[j:idx]
            alist[j] = value
            print('intermediary:', alist)
        return alist
```

The following code can be used to test the above code:

```python
# Test case using random shuffle
from random import shuffle
alist = list(range(10))
shuffle(alist)

print("Unsorted", alist)
print("Sorted", insertsort(alist))
```

## In-class Demo

- [http://j.mp/compareSort](http://j.mp/compareSort)

## Algorithm

- In `selectsort`, the position of the update is pre-determined, starting from the beginning of the list. We then go **select** the maximum value among the unsorted elements of the list, and swap it with the element in the pre-determined location.

Here's an example:
![select](http://bit.ly/select2PNG)

    	repeat (numOfElements - 1) times
    		for each of the unsorted elements
    		select the minimum value among them
    		swap minimum with first unsorted position

## Source code

### Version 1

```python
def selectionsort(alist):
    n = len(alist)
    # STEP 0 - iterate through the list
    for i in range(n-1):
        min_i = i
        # STEP 1 - update mini_i with index
        # of min value in unsorted alist[i+1:]
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            if alist[j] < alist[min_i]:
                min_i = j
        # STEP 2 - swap it with element at index 'i'
        if min_i != i:
            alist[i], alist[min_i] = alist[min_i], alist[i]
    return alist
```

### Version 2

```python
def selectsort(alist):
    n = len(alist)
    # STEP 0 - iterate through the list
    for i in range(n-1):
        # STEP 1 - find the index of the minimum
        unsorted = alist[i:]
        smallest = min(unsorted)
        min_i = alist.index(smallest, i)
        # STEP 2 - swap if required
        if min_i != i:
            alist[i],alist[min_i] = alist[min_i], alist[i]
            print("intermediary", alist)
    return alist

```

### Version 3

- uses `slicing`, `tuples` and `list comprehension` to make the code very efficient and eminently readable.

```python
def selectsort(alist):
    n = len(alist)
    for i in range(n-1):
        unsorted = alist[i:]
        (minval, min_idx) = min((v, i) \
            for i, v in enumerate(unsorted))
        alist[i], alist[min_idx+i] = alist[min_idx+i], alist[i]
        print("intermediary", alist)
    return alist

tlist = [85, 69, 12, 12, 54, 36, 45, 5]
print("unsorted", tlist)
print("sorted:", selectsort(tlist))
```

### Bonus

Can you improve on the **basic selection sort**? How about grabbing the maximum value during every iteration and using it?

## In-class demo

[MergeSort Color](http://j.mp/mergeVisual)

## Visualization

Notice that at each level we divide the array into two halves until we get bunch of single element arrays. This is the divide portion of the divide and conquer method. Then, we start merging and sorting the smaller arrays in a series of steps which is the conquer portion of divide and conquer.

![mergeGIF](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/Merge-sort-example-300px.gif)

## Merge example

0. Use a 4-element array to explain mergesort - why should it be 8 and so confusing upfront?
1. With reference to below diagram, how many lists are there in Row 4?
2. Until what row is **Divide** happening?
3. From which row onwards **Conquer** has begun?

![mergeExample](http://bit.ly/mergeExample2)

- InsertSort and SelectionSort are examples of **comparison** sorts
- However, MergeSort, is an example of the **Divide-and-Conquer** algorithm sorts

  - **Divide** means portioning the n-element array to be sorted into two sub-arrays of n/2 elements. If A is an array containing zero or one element, then it is already sorted. However, if there are more elements in the array, divide A into two sub-arrays, A1 and A2, each containing about half of the elements of A.
  - **Conquer** means sorting the two sub-arrays recursively using merge sort. Combine means merging the two sorted sub-arrays of size n/2 to produce the sorted array of n elements.

## Algorithm

Means what it sounds like. A divide and conquer algorithm breaks up a problem into smaller sub-problems and solves those, putting the solutions to the sub-problems together to come up with the solution to the total problem.

- In `mergesort`, a divide-and-conquer partitioning algorithm (which more often requires extra memory), the input array is divided in two halves, calls itself recursively for the two halves and then merges the two sorted halves. The `merge()` function is used for merging two halves.

The basic steps in the recursive MergeSort Algorithm is as follows:

    Func MERGESORT:
        input (unsorted list of elements)  `ulist`
        output (sorted list of elements)   `slist`

    - TERMINAL CASE:
    	- if size of list is 0 or 1, return (since it is sorted)
    - Split the unsorted list (`ulist`) into equal sublists: left sublist and right sublist
    - Recursively call MergeSort on the left sublist (`leftA`)
    - Recursively call MergeSort on the right sublist (`leftB`)
    - Merge the sorted left and sorted right sublists to form one sorted list
    - Return the sorted list (`slist`)

## Source code

```python
# a helper function for the mergesort function
# function to merge already sorted lists
def merge(A, B):
  C = []
  while A and B:
    candidate = (A if A[0] < B[0] else B).pop(0)
    C.append(candidate)

  # pick up the residual elements in A or B
  return C + A + B

def mergesort(ulist):
  if len(ulist) <= 1:
    return ulist

  mid = len(ulist)//2

  leftA    = ulist[:mid]
  rightB   = ulist[mid:]

  sortedA  = mergesort(leftA)
  sortedB  = mergesort(rightB)

  slist = merge(sortedA, sortedB)
  return slist

# test cases
assert (merge([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 10]) == \

# Histogram

![histo](http://j.mp/histoPNG)

- http://bit.ly/histogramVisual

## Pre-requisites

- Histogram

  - Write a sample code snippet which uses list comprehension to create a list of numbers from 1 to 10
  - Use the built-in **divmod**() function to divide 222 by 7 and unpack the quotient and remainder into a tuple, and print the tuple
  - Create a list that contains all the keys in a dictionary. What is the code?
  - Create a list that contains all the values in a dictionary. What is the code?
  - Create a list of tuples from a dictionary that contains all the key:value pairs.
    - Sort the tuples in the list based on its value in descending order
    - Write code for both the above.
  - Can a string be a key in a dictionary? Can a list like `[1, 2, 3]` be a key in a dictionary? Why not?
  - Can an integer be a key in the dictionary? Can a tuple like `(5, 10)` be a key in a dictionary? Why not?

  - Create a histogram with tuples that represent bins (interval specified by low and high values) of sufficient width and see the typical double peaks that occur in random data

## Algorithm

- We build a histogram using a dictionary where the keys of the dictionary will be the letters in the string and the associated values for each key will be the number of times that the letter appeared.

- What about a letter that does not appear in the string? It will never be placed in the dictionary. By assumption, any key that is not in the dictionary has a count of 0.

1.  Define the function to require one parameter, the string.
2.  Create an empty dictionary of counts.
3.  Iterate through the characters of the string, one character at a time.

## Version 2

A histogram contains bins (lower bound, upper bound), and statistical values are dropped into these bins. Eventually, the histogram is visualized based on the bin counts. This type of histogram is what is used in more statistical analysis.

# Epilogue

_A speech at the end of a play that serves as a comment on or a conclusion to what has happened._

**InsertionSort**, **SelectionSort** and **MergeSort** algorithms were covered in detail, primarily using a **Show-And-Tell** approach which is most intuitive. Also, the approach is very effective in engaging students of diverse learning capabilities.

A comparison screenshot of the three sorts in action in "verbose" mode is presented below. The screenshot helps differentiate the three sorting algorithms when they process the same unsorted list as a test case. The **_curious_** student will want to trace how the unsorted list becomes a sorted one in each of the three cases.

**UPDATE: May 30, 2022**
_Added bubblesort (for AD3251)_   
![bubble](https://i.imgur.com/AW0GrdY.png)
 
  - bubblesort: compare adjacent elements and swap, as you iterate the list
  - insertionsort : get a key and **insert** it into *sorted* sublist
  - selectionsort : **select** minimum value and swap into *sorted* sublist 
  - mergesort :  divide and **merge** (_conquer_) of *sorted* sublists
  - quicksort: choose a pivot and partition (_divide_) into big and small sublists and then combine them

## Helper functions

Three helper functions (`insort`, `min_index` and `merge`) were written and used in the respective sorting implementation.

These helper functions are very effective in capturing the core of each of the algorithm. Also, they help in presenting the algorithm in an incremental fashion, reducing the cognitive load on the student.

```python
def  insort(alist, key, j):
    '''insort inserts 'key' into the sorted alist[:j]
    so that it remains sorted
    'j' is the current index of 'key' in alist
    '''
    while j > 0 and alist[j-1] > key:
        alist[j] = alist[j-1]
        j -= 1
    alist[j] = key
```

http://j.mp/insortCC

```python
def min_index(alist, i):
    '''function returns the index of the
    minimum value in the sublist alist[i:]
    '''
    n = len(alist)
    min_i = i
    for j in range(i+1, n):
        if alist[j] < alist[min_i]:
            min_i = j
    return min_i
```

- _How can you refactor the above function to have only one line of code?_
- _If `i` is not provided, how will you default it to an appropriate value?_

```python
def  merge(A, B):
    '''
    merge generates a new sorted list containing
    all elements contained in both sorted lists
    '''
    C =  []
    while A and B:
        smaller = (A if A[0]  < B[0]  else B).pop(0)
        C.append(smaller)
    # pick up the residual elements in A or B
    return C + A + B
```
