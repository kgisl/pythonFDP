# Guidelines for Evaluation

**OBJECTIVE**: To tell the world why you as a CSE faculty care about 
algorithms, which is the bedrock of Computer Science. Secondly, your 
presentation must motivate and inspire your peers and students to adopt an 
algorithm of their choice and be inspired to make a presentation which is as 
fascinating as yours. 

**IMPORTANT**: Bonus points for adopting PechaKucha format, and sticking to 400 
seconds (20 by 20). No more than 10 minutes, whatsoever. 

> 1. Personality of the presentation - there is no right or wrong in your 
choice of algorithm. All that matters, why are _you_ passionate about the 
algorithm and what about it is so fascinating from your perspective? 
> 2. Choose at least one real-world application that the algorithm finds use 
for. Don't choose more than two. Describe the real-world application. 
> 3. Show the code for the algorithm either in pseudo code or your favourite 
language
> 4. Choose whatever format makes sense to you to present all the above three. 
Bring your creativity to the fore.

	- It's not an algorithm, but a data structure.  I've always marveled at 
the simple tree-based data structure for disjoint-set union, using union by 
rank and path compression (Section 21.3 in the third edition of CLRS).  The 
code is amazingly simple, the data structure operations take just barely 
superlinear time, and the analysis (by Bob Tarjan) blows my mind.

## Nine Algorithms that change the World 

An algorithm is a well defined procedure for performing a task. A household 
example of an algorithm is a recipe -- for example, the list of ingredients 
together with the sequence of instructions needed to bake a pie. In order for a 
computer to perform a task, it needs ingredients -- the data -- and 
instructions -- the algorithm.

Author John MacCormick, currently Professor of Computer Science at Dickinson 
College, has chosen nine important tasks performed by computers and explained 
the algorithms that are used. In a chapter devoted to each, he explains:

 - The development of search engines -- how to find information on the internet.
 - The PageRank process used by Google to produce highly relevant search 
results.
 - Public-key cryptography, enabling secure transmission of secret messages -- 
such as your credit card number -- over open communication channels.
 - Methods for detecting errors in data transmission and automatically 
correcting them.
 - Several pattern recognition techniques, illustrated by classifying 
handwritten numbers, facial recognition, and decision trees.
 - Data compression. Storing text, music, and images efficiently.
 - Databases. Storing and retrieving information efficiently. Techniques for 
modifying databases reliably, even when computers crash while the modification 
is in progress.
 - Digital signatures. How to be certain data is trustworthy.
 - Deciding what is computable.

Even though the techniques that enable these algorithms are complex, Dr. 
MacCormick explains them in a clear and interesting manner using well 
constructed examples.

I highly recommend this book for a fascinating and easily accessible look at 
the core of computer science and its application to everyday lives.
