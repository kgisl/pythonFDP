### Things to Decide
  - choice of IDE? https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/ - is it available online?
  - CloudCoder problems to go over? 
  - CyberDojo sessions? 
  - Who wants to focus on RPA? 
	  - We now can enroll some faculty to become RPA experts / consultants...both in KGCAS and KITE and they can progress on their own to some level of expertise...and take students along.

### Draft Agenda

0. http://bit.ly/fizzBuzzVideoCD for review before workshop
1. Blockly 10-part challenge and Python equivalent code review 
2. CD-1 review of http://j.mp/fizzBuzzPythonFDP 
5. Part 2 - OOP version Custom Start - http://j.mp/oopFizzBuzzCD
3. Part 3 - expand CD-2 to output sequence 
4. Part 4 - expand CD-3 to output for FizzBuzzPlus⁠⁠⁠⁠


### Learning Pathway
