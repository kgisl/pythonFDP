**GE8151 PROBLEM SOLVING AND PYTHON PROGRAMMING L T P C**

**3 0 0 3**

# OBJECTIVES:

- To know the basics of algorithmic problem solving
- To read and write simple Python programs.
- To develop Python programs with conditionals and loops.
- To define Python functions and call them.
- To use Python data structures –- lists, tuples, dictionaries.
- To do input/output with files in Python.

# UNIT I ALGORITHMIC PROBLEM SOLVING 9

Algorithms, building blocks of algorithms (statements, state, control
flow, functions), notation (pseudo code, flow chart, programming
language), algorithmic problem solving, simple strategies for
developing algorithms (iteration, recursion). Illustrative problems:
find [minimum in a list](http://j.mp/matrixMultiplyCC), insert a card in a list of sorted cards, guess
an integer number in a range, Towers of Hanoi.


# UNIT II DATA, EXPRESSIONS, STATEMENTS 9

Python interpreter and interactive mode; values and types: int, float,
boolean, string, and list; variables, expressions, statements, tuple
assignment, precedence of operators, comments; modules and functions,
function definition and use, flow of execution, parameters and
arguments; Illustrative programs: exchange the values of two
variables, circulate the values of n variables, [distance between two
points](http://j.mp/twoPoints).

# UNIT III CONTROL FLOW, FUNCTIONS 9

Conditionals: Boolean values and operators, conditional (if),
alternative (if-else), chained conditional (if-elif-else); Iteration:
state, while, for, break, continue, pass; Fruitful functions: return
values, parameters, local and global scope, function composition,
recursion; Strings: string slices, immutability, string functions and
methods, string module; Lists as arrays. Illustrative programs: square
root, gcd, exponentiation, sum an array of numbers, linear search,
binary search.

# UNIT IV LISTS, TUPLES, DICTIONARIES 9

Lists: list operations, list slices, list methods, list loop,
mutability, aliasing, cloning lists, list parameters; Tuples: tuple
assignment, tuple as return value; Dictionaries: operations and
methods; advanced list processing - list comprehension; Illustrative
programs: selection sort, insertion sort, mergesort, histogram.

# UNIT V FILES, MODULES, PACKAGES 9

Files and exception: text files, reading and writing files, format
operator; command line arguments, errors and exceptions, handling
exceptions, modules, packages; Illustrative programs: word count, copy
file.

# OUTCOMES:

**Upon completion of the course, students will be able to**

- Develop algorithmic solutions to simple computational problems
- Read, write, execute by hand simple Python programs.
- Structure simple Python programs for solving problems.
- Decompose a Python program into functions.
- Represent compound data using Python lists, tuples, dictionaries.
- Read and write data from/to files in Python Programs.
